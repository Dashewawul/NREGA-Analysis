## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes data from the **National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA)** program in India. The dataset contains government records showing employment generation, budget allocation, expenditure, and work completion statistics across states and districts.

The goal of this Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is to:

- Understand dataset structure
- Identify trends in employment generation
- Examine budget utilization
- Analyze workforce participation
- Detect inefficiencies in implementation

---

## 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains **28 columns** including:

- Job cards issued
- Workforce participation
- Employment provided
- Budget allocation
- Total expenditure
- Ongoing works
- Completed works
- Wage payments
- Women participation
- Differently-abled participation

Coverage:
- **34 States**
- **736 Districts**

---

Insight:

* Budget utilization extremely low.

Budget utilization ratio ≈ **0.0025**

---

## 🚧 Work Progress Analysis

Metrics:

* Total Works Taken Up: **17 million**
* Ongoing Works: **13 million**
* Completed Works Rate: **22%**

```python
completion_rate = completed_works / total_works
```

Observation:

* Significant backlog in project completion.

## 👩 Gender Participation Analysis

Women Person Days:

* **979 million**

Insight:

* Strong female workforce participation indicates social inclusion success.

---

## ♿ Inclusion Analysis

Differently Abled Workers:

* **396,000 workers**

Indicates inclusive employment but still relatively low participation.

---

## 📉 Key Insights from EDA

1. High program participation across districts.
2. Very low budget utilization efficiency.
3. Work completion rate below average (22%).
4. Strong women participation impact.
5. Large number of active job cards (97 million).

## ✅ Conclusion from EDA

The NREGA program successfully generates employment but struggles with:

* Execution efficiency
* Budget spending
* Project completion timelines
