## 🎯 Modelling Objective

The aim of modelling is to:

- Predict employment generation
- Identify factors influencing program effectiveness
- Understand relationships between budget, works, and employment

Target Variable:

👉 `employment_provided`

---

## 📚 Libraries

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, r2_score
````

---

## 📥 Data Preparation

```python
df = pd.read_csv("nrega_cleaned.csv")
```

### Feature Selection

Features used:

* approved_budget
* total_expenditure
* ongoing_works
* completed_works
* active_job_cards
* wage_rate

```python
X = df[['approved_budget','total_expenditure',
        'ongoing_works','completed_works',
        'active_job_cards','wage_rate']]

y = df['employment_provided']
```

---

## ✂️ Train-Test Split

```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

---

## 🧠 Model Selection

Model Used:

* Linear Regression

Reason:

* Interpretability
* Understanding policy drivers

---

## ⚙️ Model Training

```python
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

---

## 🔍 Predictions

```python
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

---

## 📏 Model Evaluation

```python
mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, predictions)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, predictions)

print(mae, r2)
```

Evaluation Metrics:

* MAE → measures prediction error
* R² → explains variance captured by model

---

## 📊 Feature Importance

```python
importance = pd.DataFrame({
    'Feature': X.columns,
    'Coefficient': model.coef_
})
importance.sort_values(by='Coefficient', ascending=False)
```

Key Drivers Identified:

* Budget allocation strongly influences employment
* Active job cards highly predictive
* Work completion positively correlated with employment

---

## 📈 Model Insights

1. Increasing expenditure efficiency improves employment outcomes.
2. States with higher work completion achieve better employment rates.
3. Budget allocation alone does not guarantee results — execution matters.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Try Random Forest Regressor
* Add time-series analysis
* State-wise modelling
* Policy efficiency scoring model

---

## ✅ Conclusion

The model confirms that NREGA effectiveness depends more on:

* execution efficiency
* project completion
* active workforce participation

rather than budget allocation alone.
